<h3>Where Museums and Technology Meet</h3>
<p>Curator. Conservator. Wikipedian? In the future, says Phyllis Hecht, director of the Advanced Academic Programs' Master of Arts in Museum Studies, more and more museums may have a "Wikipedian in Residence," acting as a liaison between the museum and Wikipedia to improve online information about their museum on the online encyclopedia. In June 2012, 20 part-time Museum Studies graduate students will have the opportunity to learn from and work with the Wikipedian at the Museu Picasso de Barcelona to research objects in the museum's collections and add content to its Wikipedia entry as part of the program's two week on-site seminar. Not only will students have the chance to put their course work to practice, but this will be one of the rare opportunities for Museum Studies students to see each other in person, since this graduate program is as virtual as Wikipedia itself.</p>
 
<p>Hecht characterizes the fruition of this innovative, part-time, online degree as "a confluence of ideas" between herself and Robert Kargon, the Willis K. Shepard Chair of the Department ofHistory of Science and Technology. "We felt that technology and global perspective were imperative for this program," says Hecht, adding that "there is a desperate need in the field for an online part-time program where people don't have to move or leave their jobs to participate." </p>
 
<p>Started in 2008, the program draws students from all over the world, creating a global conversation on museums and their roles in different cultures. Approximately one-third of the students already work in museums when they enter the program; the other two-thirds are new to the museum field, career-changers or members of museum boards.</p>
 
<p>As with many museum studies programs, there is the classic emphasis on curatorship, exhibition strategies, and fundraising, but technology plays a huge role not only as a subject for study but as a teaching and learning tool. Beyond the online course management tool, classes use Google Docs, VoiceThread, Wikis, and all types of social media;there are even assignments involving Twitter. "Using technology in assignments builds a learning community and gives students ways to work on assignments together," says Hecht. "But another benefit is that it gives students tools they can introduce to their professional work." Since the program's inception, students have worked on video podcasts for the Walters Art Museum and the Textile Museum and audio podcasts for the Hillwood Estate, Museum, and Gardens in Washington, D.C.</p>
 
<p>"Technology has been the stepchild of the museum," says Hecht, and yet there are "so many ways technology runs through museums&#8212;in collection information management, outreach, business social processes, social media, and in online programming." The Museum Studies program prepares students to embrace "new ways of technology to engage the [museum] visitor and the global community."</p>
