			<h4>Finding Museums in unlikely places</h4>
			<p>Johns Hopkins is home to three traditional museums&#8212;Homewood Museum, Evergreen Museum &amp; Library, and the Archaeological Museum&#8212;all rich representatives of our cultural fabric. Dig a little deeper, and you'll find Johns Hopkins faculty, students, and alumni involved in a broad array of museum studies and work, asking questions such as what makes a museum a museum? And where do museums live?</p> 
			<p>In a quest to tackle those questions, <strong>Erik Ledbetter '88</strong>, of the International Council of Museums, sets the stage with a "big picture" essay about the nature of museums today and the challenges they face to stay relevant. Then we bring you a sampling of the museum-related explorations under way in the School of Arts and Sciences, which just might make you think of museums in a whole new way.</p>
			<h3 align="center">Museums in Transition, at Johns Hopkins and Beyond<br>
			Erik G. Ledbetter '88</h3>
			<p>The museum in its modern form is a newcomer to American public life. Bursting on the scene in large numbers only during the 1890s and early 1900s, museums postdate magazines and newspapers like The Atlantic and the New York Times, and both our major political parties. Dating to 1876, Johns Hopkins is by no means an old university, but it is senior by four decades to its Homewood neighbor, the Baltimore Museum of Art.</p> 
			<p>Yet for relative newcomers, museums enjoy a place of remarkable and enduring trust in American life. At a time when long-established entities like universities, newspapers, and political parties see their audiences fall and their authority challenged daily, museums go from strength to strength. Not only do Americans line up around the corner to take in blockbuster shows like the recent Picasso exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, we also come in the tens, hundreds, and thousands to smaller art and history museums, nature centers and children's museums, science centers and living history sites all across the country. More Americans attend museums each year than go to all professional sporting events combined&#8212;yes, more than all the pro football and basketball games, monster truck shows, and NASCAR races put together.</p> 
			<p>Why do museums occupy such a key position in our civic life? Part of the answer lies in the authenticity of their collections. In an age of synthetic experiences, museums remain bastions of the "real." Objects in their collections have length and breadth, mass and heft, the patina of age. They have the intangible quality that comes from close association with great events and terrible struggles, with lives gone by, and with the high creativity as well as the daily commonplaces of ages and people past. Our response to these objects is irrational&#8212;any undergrad can tell you that the atoms that make up these totems are identical in every way to all other atoms of their type&#8212;but it's a glorious, transcendent kind of irrationality. The power of objects to work on the soul remains the abiding strength of museums.</p>
			<p>That said, challenges abound. Museums face a stringent fiscal climate for the foreseeable future. New forms of entertainment like online gaming and social media are becoming formidable competitors for Americans' time and attention. Most of all, museums face a profound demographic challenge. In an America in which people of color will soon be a national majority, museum audiences remain disproportionately&#8212;indeed, overwhelmingly&#8212;white. There is nothing in the concept of the museum itself that prevents it from speaking to these new Americans from new and different cultural backgrounds, but that is not the same as saying that every single museum currently extant will remain relevant. </p>
			<p>What's more, in trying to address these challenges, contemporary museum professionals sometimes leave their own audiences confused and wanting more. Overwhelmed with choices and contested narratives in every other part of life, visitors come to museums clamoring to be told clear, reliable stories. Yet today, museum professionals often feel a responsibility to mute their own voices. Stung by their past close association with triumphal narratives that privileged the experience of white men over that of other Americans, history curators today sometimes feel more comfortable raising questions than they do presenting clear narratives with good and bad actors, winners and losers.  Visitors come to art museums still demanding to be taught what is most excellent in human creativity, yet art curators and educators today grow ever more uneasy with the concept of connoisseurship and the imposition of an artistic canon on visitor's minds and tastes.</p>
			<p>As home to a new undergraduate concentration in museum studies at Homewood and a revolutionary online master's program in the Krieger School's Advanced Academic Programs, Johns Hopkins is at the forefront of educating the next generation of museum professionals. And as custodian to three very fine&#8212;yet also very traditional&#8212;museums in Baltimore, JHU faces the struggle to make older collections relevant to new audiences. It's a challenging time for museums, and JHU is meeting the challenges through scholarship and practice alike.</p>
