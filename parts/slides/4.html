<h3>Science on Display</h3>

<p><img class="floatleft" src="../../wp-content/themes/asmagflex/assets/images/v9n2/4-BillLeslie.jpg" />The first minutes of discussion in Professor Stuart "Bill" Leslie's Science on Display class are playful. What stands out from your visit to the Chamber of Wonders at The Walters Art Museum? Leslie asks the class. A big moose head, says one student. A snake skin so large you could see only half of it in the display, says another. Starfish. Crystals. Shells.</p>
<p>And what stands out in today's reading? Leslie asks, referring to Mr. Wilson's Cabinet of Wonder, Lawrence Weschler's profile of MacArthur Fellow David Wilson and his idiosyncratic museum-cum-installation, The Museum of Jurassic Technology in Los Angeles. Inhaled objects, a human horn, fruit stone carvings, the students volunteer.</p>
<p>At dizzying speed, the class progresses through a discussion of authenticity versus inauthenticity, touching on conventional notions of what a visitor expects from a museum and how Wilson's museum upends the idea of museum-as-institutional authority and challenges the "passive mode" of museum learning.</p>
<p>Science on Display doesn't confine its focus to traditional museums. In order to help students  "become critical viewers of popular science," says Leslie, the class puts what Leslie calls "public discussions of science"&#8212;in film, fiction, gardens, World's Fairs, and, yes, museums&#8212;under the microscope in disparate ways. The classes focusing on botanical gardens, for example, include a discussion of both the Pauly Shore "classic" film Biodome and an examination of Pacific exploration and 18th-century natural history.</p>
<p>The class culminates in the students' final project: a proposal for their own museum, either virtual or in diorama form, a sort of sweetly old-fashioned corollary to the chamber of wonders discussion. In the brief history of the course, students have created museums of time-keeping, medicine, and sports technology. What would Leslie do for his project? He glances at his metallic green, custom-built Hollands bike leaning against the wall. "A history of bicycles," he says without missing a beat.</p>
