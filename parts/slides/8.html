<h3>Wunderkammer</h3>
<p>When the committee charged with commissioning a public art project for the Quiet Reading Room in the new Brody Learning Commons began a discussion of possible artists, they knew they wanted an artist whose work would be a deep response to the university and its history.</p>
<p>Within five minutes of meeting Mark Dion, says Jackie O'Regan, Hopkins' curator of cultural properties, the committee was on board with his vision. Dion's Wunderkammer or Cabinet of Wonder, an installation inspired by the cabinets of curiosity, or "wonder-rooms," of Renaissance Europe, will be open to public view in October 2012.</p>
<p>Dion, who has been working in the Wunderkammer tradition for 20 years, explains in his project proposal: "Adopting the Wunderkammer model and imagining the university as universe, our visual cabinet will be an archaeology of the material culture of knowledge&#8212;a microcosm of the university's collections." 
<p>Dion acts as both curator and artist, and his method includes "going into the closets, going into the backrooms" of university departments and labs, explains O'Regan. "[His work asks] what does what's hidden away teach us about the university?"</p>
<p>Dion has scoured the campus for a treasure trove of finds to fill and build his Wunderkammer. The Cabinet of Wonder may contain fossils from the medical campus as well as rocks and specimens from the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences in Olin Hall, a "fantastic collection find," says O'Regan. Part of the laboratory that belonged to Saul Roseman, former chair of the biology department, who passed away recently, will form some of the casework of the installation. Dion believes that the piece should not only hold found objects but be built of them as well.</p>
<p>Dion visited many sites on campus and found piles of scientific research instruments and inventions, evidence, O'Regan says, of a research university at work and 
moving forward.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the installation will consist of three cabinet pieces and may include thousands of parts, all of which O'Regan hopes will be documented in a field guide and checklist created by Johns Hopkins students via paid internships for them and a paid practicum for one Maryland Institute College of Art student. "What Dion is creating," says O'Regan, "is a kind of museum and gathering place to see and be able to study and research some of our material culture."</p>
